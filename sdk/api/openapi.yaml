    As an option to increase org security, Okta supports CAPTCHA services to prevent automated sign-in attempts. You can integrate one of two providers: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) or [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible).

    The vendor implementations supported by Okta are both invisible. They each run risk-analysis software in the background during user sign in to determine the likelihood that the user is a bot. This risk analysis is based on the settings that you configure with the provider that you choose.

    Before you configure your org to use CAPTCHA, sign in to the vendor of your choice or sign up for an account. For more details, refer to [CAPTCHA integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-captcha).

    \ objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external\
    \ service, \nand sample JSON objects that you can include in your response.\n\n\
    The password import inline hook allows you to migrate users from another data\
    \ store where you want the users to retain their current passwords.\nUse this\
    \ hook with the [Create User with password import inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook)\
    \ flow that's provided by the [Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/).\n\
    \nThe password import inline hook is triggered when the end user tries to sign\
    \ in to Okta for the first time. Okta sends your external service the password\
    \ that the user supplied. Your external service then needs to send a response\
    \ to Okta indicating whether the password supplied by the end user is valid.\n\
    \nIf your service returns a response that indicates that the password is valid,\
    \ Okta sets the password for the user. The password import inline hook won't need\
    \ to call your service again. \nHowever, if the Okta service is in read-only mode,\

    \ import inline hook per org.\n\n### Enable a password import inline hook\n\n\
    To enable a password import inline hook, you first need to register your external\
    \ service endpoint with Okta and configure it as an inline hook of type `com.okta.user.credential.password.import`.\
    \ \nSee [Inline hook setup](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/#inline-hook-setup)\
    \ or [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook).\n\
    \nWhen creating a user with the `/users` API, you need to use the [Create User\
    \ with password import inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook)\
    \ use case. \nThis involves specifying a `credentials.password.hook` property\
    \ in the request body.\n\nWhen the end user that you have added attempts to sign\
    \ in to Okta for the first time, the hook is triggered and Okta calls your external\
    \ service. The call sends the credentials that the end user provided. Your service\
    \ can check \nthe credentials and respond with a command to indicate whether the\
    \ credentials are valid or not.\n\n### Password inline hook and Okta read-only\
    \ mode\n\nIf your external service responds to Okta indicating that the credentials\
    \ are valid, Okta saves the password \nand can authenticate the user independently\
    \ from then on. However, if your Okta org is in a special [read-only mode](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/What-is-Oktas-Readonly-Mode)\
    \ \nat the time the end user signs in, then saving the password might not be possible.\
    \ The\nnext time the end user attempts to sign in, the password import inline\
    \ hook needs to be called again.\n\n### Password removal from an existing user\
    \ store\n\nBecause of the possibility of your org being in a special service mode,\
    \ you shouldn't attempt to permanently delete user passwords from your \nexisting\
    \ user store until you can verify the success of the password import . An Okta\
    \ System Log \nEvent, `user.import.password`, is available for this purpose. An\
    \ event of this type is created every time a password \nimport inline hook is\
    \ fired, with its `Event.Outcome` property providing a status of `FAILURE` or\
    \ `SUCCESS` for the \npassword import operation. If the status is `SUCCESS`, Okta\
    \ has successfully saved the end user's password, and \nit's safe to delete it\
    \ from your previous user store.\n\nYou can configure an [Event hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/)\

    Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

    1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
    2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

    For each relationship:

    * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
    * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
    * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

    Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

    > **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

    ## Example usage

    Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

    * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
    * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
    * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

    Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

    You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

    For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

    * Joe is Frank's manager.
    * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
    * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

    Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

    Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

    * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
    * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

    Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

    To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

    ## Links between User Types

    If you created multiple User Types, they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

    The Okta Network Zones API provides operations to manage Zones in your organization. There are two usage Zone types: Policy Network Zones and Blocklist Network Zones. Policy Network Zones are used to guide policy decisions. Blocklist Network Zones are used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, proxy types, or Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) before policy evaluation.

    A default system Policy Network Zone is provided in your Okta org. You can use the Network Zones API to modify the default Policy Network Zone or to create a custom Policy or Blocklist Network Zone. When you create your custom Zone, you can specify if the Zone is an IP Zone or a Dynamic Zone. An IP Zone allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs, whereas a Dynamic Zone allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, and ASNs.

The Policy framework is used by Okta to control Rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multi-factor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances, and what identity provider to route users to.

    Policy settings for a particular Policy type, such as Sign On Policy, consist of one or more Policy objects, each of which contains one or more Policy Rules. Policies and Rules contain conditions that determine whether they are applicable to a particular user at a particular time.

    Role targets are a way of defining permissions for admin roles into a smaller subset of Groups or Apps within your org. Targets limit an admin's permissions to a targeted area of the org. You can define admin roles to target Groups, Applications, and Application Instances.

    * **Group targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage only a specified Group. For example, an admin role may be assigned to manage only the IT Group.
    * **App targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage all instances of the specified Apps. Target Apps are Okta catalog Apps. For example, you can have multiple configurations of an Okta catalog App, such as Salesforce or Facebook. When you add a Salesforce or Facebook App as a target, that grants the admin permission to manage all the instances of those Apps and create new instances of them.
    * **App Instance targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage an instance of one App or instances of multiple Apps. App Instances are specific Apps that admins have created in their org. For example, there may be a Salesforce App configured differently for each sales region of a company. When you create an App Instance target, you can assign an admin to manage only two instances of the configured Salesforce Apps and then also to manage an instance of another configured App such as Workday.

    > **Note:** Don't use these operations with a Custom Role ID. Custom Role assignments always require a target Resource Set. See [Role Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/role-assignment/) for more information.

    > **Note:** This is an EA release feature that's currently available to a selected audience.
    > This feature is only available as a part of Okta Identity Engine. Your Okta org must have the SSF Receiver API feature enabled.
    > Contact your Okta account team to enable this feature.

    Okta uses the [Shared Signals Framework (SSF)](https://sharedsignals.guide/) to receive security-related events and other data-subject signals from third-party security vendors. In this scenario, commonly used terms for third-party vendors that send signals are "transmitters", Okta is the "receiver", and the connection between the two entities is referred to as a "stream."

    The SSF Receiver API allows you to manage SSF vendor stream configurations between the transmitter and Okta. A stream is configured by [creating a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance) object in your Okta org. You can create a Security Events Provider object in Okta with a published well-known URL or an issuer-and-JWKS combination.

    After the Security Events Provider object is created for a transmitter, the provider can use the [SSF Security Event Tokens](https://preview.redoc.ly/oktadev/vl-okta-660501-ssf-receiver-api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/) API to publish events to Okta. While the SSF allows ingestion through push and poll-based operations, Okta currently supports only push-based operations.

    > This feature is only available as a part of Okta Identity Engine. Your Okta org needs to have the SSF Security Event Tokens API feature enabled.
    > Contact your Okta account team to enable this feature.

    The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) Security Event Tokens API allows third-party security event providers to send Security Event Tokens (SETs) to Okta. The provider must be configured in Okta as a Security Events Provider instance before transmitting a SET to Okta. See [Create a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance). After the token is verified, any appropriate action is performed upon ingestion.

    Okta uses the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) defined by the [OpenID Shared Signals and Events Framework specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html). A risk signal is ingested as a Security Event Token (SET), a type of JSON Web Token (JWT) that must comply with the SET standard: [RFC 8417 - Security Event Token(SET)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417). The `security.events.provider.receive_event` System Log event is created when a SET is published to Okta successfully.

    The Schemas API provides operations to manage custom User profiles as well as endpoints to discover the structure of the Log Stream configuration.

    Okta's [Universal Directory](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_About_Universal_Directory) allows administrators to define custom User profiles for Okta Users and Applications.
    Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible User profiles.
    For Log Stream Schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
    [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a lightweight declarative format for describing the structure, constraints, and validation of JSON documents.

    > **Note:** Okta implements only a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). This document describes which parts apply to Okta, and any extensions Okta has made to [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

    Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

    >**Notes:**
    > * Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [Mitigate the impact of third-party cookie deprecation](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-third-party-cookies).
    > * The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

    ### Session cookie

    Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

    ### Session token

    A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

    Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

    >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

    The System Log records system events that are related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

    The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your organization's system log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

    The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

    The System Log API supports these primary use cases:
      * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
      * System monitoring
      * Development debugging
      * Event introspection and audit

    The System Log API isn't intended for use as a Database as a Service (DBaaS) or to serve data directly to downstream consumers without an intermediate data store.

    See [Events API Migration](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/events-api-migration/) for information on migrating from the Events API to the System Log API.

If the origins aren't specified, the related operation (redirect or Okta API access) isn't permitted.

    You can also configure Trusted Origins to allow iFrame embedding of Okta resources, such as Okta sign-in pages and the Okta End-User Dashboard, within that origin. This is an Early Access feature. To enable it, contact [Okta Support](https://support.okta.com/help/s/).

        Assigns an application to an [authentication policy](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/), identified by `policyId`.
        If the application was previously assigned to another policy, this operation replaces that assignment with the updated policy identified by `policyId`.

        > **Note:** When you [merge duplicate authentication policies](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-merge-auth-policies),
        the policy and mapping CRUD operations may be unavailable during the consolidation. When the consolidation is complete, you receive an email.

          > **Note:** For OIDC apps, user profiles don't contain the `firstName` or `lastName` attributes. Therefore, the query only matches against the `userName` or `email` attributes.

        Assigns a user to an app for:

          * SSO only<br>
            Assignments to SSO apps typically don't include a user profile.
            However, if your SSO app requires a profile but doesn't have provisioning enabled, you can add profile attributes in the request body.

          * SSO and provisioning<br>
            Assignments to SSO and provisioning apps typically include credentials and an app-specific profile.
            Profile mappings defined for the app are applied first before applying any profile properties that are specified in the request body.
            > **Notes:**
            > * When Universal Directory is enabled, you can only specify profile properties that aren't defined in profile mappings.
            > * Omit mapped properties during assignment to minimize assignment errors.

        Unassigns a user from an app

        For directories like Active Directory and LDAP, they act as the owner of the user's credential with Okta delegating authentication (DelAuth) to that directory.
        If this request is successful for a user when DelAuth is enabled, then the user is in a state with no password. You can then reset the user's password.

        > **Important:** This is a destructive operation. You can't recover the user's app profile. If the app is enabled for provisioning and configured to deactivate users, the user is also deactivated in the target app.

        Lists all devices with pagination support.
        You can return a subset of Devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.
        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.
        > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flows—such as authentication or updates—to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object. <br> Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss. <br> Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.
        This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

        Creates a new event hook for your organization in `ACTIVE` status. You pass an event hook object in the JSON payload
        of your request. That object represents the set of required information about the event hook you're registering, including:
          * The URI of your external service
          * The [events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/) in Okta you want to subscribe to
          * An optional event hook filter that can reduce the number of event hook calls. This is a self-service Early Access (EA) feature.
            See [Create an event hook filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#create-an-event-hook-filter).

            Additionally, you can specify a secret API key for Okta to pass to your external service endpoint for security verification. Note that the API key you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token
        you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs. Optionally, you can specify extra headers that Okta passes to your external
        service with each call.
        Your external service must use a valid HTTPS endpoint.

        Verifies that the event hook matches the provided `eventHookId`. To verify ownership, your endpoint must send information back to Okta in JSON format. See [Event hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#one-time-verification-request).

        Only `ACTIVE` and `VERIFIED` event hooks can receive events from Okta.

        If a response is not received within 3 seconds, the outbound request times out. One retry is attempted after a timeout or error response.
        If a successful response still isn't received, this operation returns a 400 error with more information about the failure.

        Updates a feature's lifecycle status. Use this endpoint to enable or disable a feature for your org.

        Use the `mode=force` parameter to override dependency restrictions for a particular feature. Normally, you can't enable a feature if it has one or more dependencies that aren't enabled.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while enabling a feature, Okta first tries to enable any disabled features that this feature may have as dependencies. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependencies that need to be enabled before the feature is enabled, a 400 error is returned.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while disabling a feature, Okta first tries to disable any enabled features that this feature may have as dependents. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependents that need to be disabled before the feature is disabled, a 400 error is returned.

        The following chart shows the different state transitions for a feature.

        Replaces the Log Stream object properties for a given ID.

        This operation is typically used to update the configuration of a Log Stream.
        Depending on the type of Log Stream you want to update, certain properties can't be modified after the Log Stream is initially created.
        Use the [Retrieve the Log Stream Schema for the schema type](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/getLogStreamSchema) request to determine which properties you can update for the specific Log Stream type.
        Log Stream properties with the `"writeOnce" : true` attribute can't be updated after creation.
        You must still specify these `writeOnce` properties in the request body with the original values in the PUT request.

        > **Note:** You don't have to specify properties that have both the `"writeOnce": true` and the `"writeOnly": true` attributes in the PUT request body. These property values are ignored even if you add them in the PUT request body.

        Lists all profile mappings in your organization with [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). You can return a subset of profile mappings that match a supported `sourceId` and/or `targetId`.
        The results are [paginated](/#pagination) according to the limit parameter. If there are multiple pages of results, the Link header contains a `next` link that should be treated as an opaque value (follow it, don't parse it).

        The response is a collection of profile mappings that include a subset of the profile mapping object's parameters. The profile mapping object describes
        the properties mapping between an Okta User and an App User Profile using [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04).

        Sends multiple IP risk events to Okta.
        This request is used by a third-party risk provider to send IP risk events to Okta. The third-party risk provider needs to be registered with Okta before they can send events to Okta. See [Risk Providers](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RiskProvider/).
        This API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute. You can include multiple risk events (up to a maximum of 20 events) in a single payload to reduce the number of API calls. Prioritize sending high risk signals if you have a burst of signals to send that would exceed the maximum request limits.

        Resends an `sms`, `call`, or `email` factor challenge as part of an enrollment flow.

        For `call` and `sms` factors, Okta enforces a rate limit of one OTP challenge per device every 30 seconds. You can configure your `sms` and `call` factors to use a third-party telephony provider. See the [Telephony inline hook reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/telephony-hook/). Okta round-robins between SMS providers with every resend request to help ensure delivery of an SMS and Call OTPs across different carriers.

        > **Note**: Resend operations aren't allowed after a factor exceeds the activation rate limit. See [Activate a Factor](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/activateFactor).

        Verifies an OTP for a Factor. Some Factors (`call`, `email`, `push`, `sms`, `u2f`, and `webauthn`) require Okta to issue a challenge to initiate the transaction. Do this by making a request without a body. After a challenge is issued, make another request to verify the Factor.

        **Note**: To verify a `push` factor, use the **poll** link returned when you issue the challenge. See [Retrieve a Factor Transaction Status](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserFactor/#tag/UserFactor/operation/getFactorTransactionStatus).

        Activates a user. This operation can only be performed on users with a `STAGED` or `DEPROVISIONED` status.
        Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The user will have the `transitioningToStatus`
        property with a value of `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        The user will have a status of `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.
        > **Multibrand and User activation**<br>
        If you want to send a branded User Activation email, change the subdomain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand.
        For example, change `subdomain.okta.com` to `custom.domain.one`. See [Multibrand and custom domains](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-custom-domains).
        <br><br>
        > **Legal disclaimer**<br>
        After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,
        you agreed not to use Okta's service/product to spam and/or send unsolicited messages.
        Please refrain from adding unrelated accounts to the directory as Okta is not responsible for, and disclaims any and all
        liability associated with, the activation email's content. You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.

        Lists all network zones with pagination. A subset of zones can be returned that match a supported filter expression or query.

        This operation requires URL encoding. For example, `filter=(id eq "nzoul0wf9jyb8xwZm0g3" or id eq "nzoul1MxmGN18NDQT0g3")` is encoded as `filter=%28id+eq+%22nzoul0wf9jyb8xwZm0g3%22+or+id+eq+%22nzoul1MxmGN18NDQT0g3%22%29`.

        Okta supports filtering on the `id` and `usage` properties. See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter) for more information on the expressions that are used in filtering.

            Indicates which value is specified in the issuer of the tokens that a custom authorization server returns: the Okta org domain URL or a custom domain URL.

            `issuerMode` is visible if you have a custom URL domain configured or the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature enabled. If you have a custom URL domain configured, you can set a custom domain URL in a custom authorization server, and this property is returned in the appropriate responses.

            When set to `ORG_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the Okta org domain URL: `https://${yourOktaDomain}`.

            When set to `CUSTOM_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL configured in the administration user interface.

            When set to `DYNAMIC`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the custom domain, or is the Okta org's domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the original Okta org domain.

            After you configure a custom URL domain, all new custom authorization servers use `CUSTOM_URL` by default. If the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature is enabled, then all new custom authorization servers use `DYNAMIC` by default. All existing custom authorization servers continue to use the original value until they're changed using the Admin Console or the API. This way, existing integrations with the client and resource server continue to work after the feature is enabled.

              Specifies the Windows version requirements for the assurance policy. Each requirement must correspond to a different major version (Windows 11 or Windows 10). If a requirement isn't specified for a major version, then devices on that major version satisfy the condition.

              There are two types of OS requirements:
              * **Static**: A specific Windows version requirement that doesn't change until you update the policy. A static OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `minimum`.
              * **Dynamic**: A Windows version requirement that is relative to the latest major release and security patch. A dynamic OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `dynamicVersionRequirement`.

              > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. The `osVersionConstraints` property is only supported for the Windows platform. You can't specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersionConstraints` properties at the same time.

        There are two types of OS requirements:

        * **Static**: A specific OS version requirement that doesn't change until you update the policy. A static OS requirement is specified with the `osVersion.minimum` property.
        * **Dynamic**: An OS version requirement that is relative to the latest major OS release and security patch. A dynamic OS requirement is specified with the `osVersion.dynamicVersionRequirement` property.
        > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. You can't specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersion.dynamicVersionRequirement` properties at the same time.

        Refresh token configuration for an OAuth 2.0 client

        When you create or update an OAuth 2.0 client, you can configure refresh token rotation by setting the `rotation_type` and `leeway` properties. If you don't set these properties when you create an app integration, the default values are used.
        When you update an app integration, your previously configured values are used.
      properties:
        leeway:
          default: 30
          description: |
            The leeway, in seconds, allowed for the OAuth 2.0 client.
            After the refresh token is rotated, the previous token remains valid for the specified period of time so clients can get the new token.

            > **Note:** A leeway of 0 doesn't necessarily mean that the previous token is immediately invalidated. The previous token is invalidated after the new token is generated and returned in the response.
